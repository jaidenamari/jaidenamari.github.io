# GitHub Pages Migration Plan - COMPLETED ✅

## Overview
This document outlines the steps that were taken to migrate the cyberpunk-blog project to the existing GitHub Pages repository (`jaidenamari.github.io`) while preserving both the new blog features and existing content/workflow.

## Current State
- New cyberpunk-blog: Next.js project with modern aesthetics
- Existing blog: Hugo-based site with Obsidian workflow for content
- The existing blog has content in `content/posts/` as markdown files with YAML frontmatter

## Migration Goals
1. Preserve existing blog posts and content ✅
2. Maintain Obsidian workflow for content creation ✅
3. Update the aesthetics with the new cyberpunk design ✅
4. Ensure a smooth transition without data loss ✅

## Step-by-Step Migration Plan

### Phase 1: Repository Setup ✅
- [x] Initialize git in the cyberpunk-blog project
- [x] Create a new branch for the migration work
- [x] Clone the existing GitHub Pages repo to a temporary location
- [x] Analyze the current GitHub Pages repo structure

### Phase 2: Content Integration ✅
- [x] Create a proper content directory structure in the cyberpunk-blog project
- [x] Update the blog.ts file to read actual markdown files instead of mock data
- [x] Copy existing blog posts from the GitHub Pages repo to the cyberpunk-blog project
- [x] Ensure the frontmatter in the markdown files is compatible with the new system

### Phase 3: Next.js Configuration for GitHub Pages ✅
- [x] Configure Next.js for static export (GitHub Pages requires static files)
- [x] Add `output: 'export'` to the next.config.mjs file
- [x] Configure basePath if needed (if the site will be at a subpath)
- [x] Create a .nojekyll file to prevent GitHub Pages from processing with Jekyll
- [x] Create a GitHub Actions workflow file for automated builds and deployments

### Phase 4: Obsidian Workflow Integration ✅
- [x] Ensure the markdown parser can handle Obsidian-specific features
- [x] Set up a content directory structure that works well with Obsidian
- [x] Document the workflow for creating and editing content using Obsidian

### Phase 5: Integration Testing ✅
- [x] Test the content rendering with existing blog posts
- [x] Verify Obsidian workflow compatibility
- [x] Test the build and export process
- [x] Make necessary adjustments to styling and formatting

### Phase 6: Deployment ✅
- [x] Add the GitHub Pages repo as a remote in the cyberpunk-blog project
- [x] Push the changes to a new branch in the GitHub Pages repo
- [x] Create a backup of the current GitHub Pages site
- [x] Deploy to the main branch when everything is verified

### Phase 7: Post-Deployment ✅
- [x] Verify all content is accessible and correctly rendered
- [x] Ensure the Obsidian workflow continues to function
- [x] Update documentation for the new content management process
- [x] Monitor for any issues

## Technical Implementation Details

### Content System Modifications
We modified `lib/blog.ts` to:
1. Read markdown files from the file system ✅
2. Parse frontmatter correctly ✅
3. Support the existing YAML frontmatter format from Hugo ✅

### Required Dependencies
- `gray-matter` for parsing frontmatter in markdown files ✅
- `fs` for reading files from the filesystem ✅
- Already have `react-markdown` for rendering ✅

### GitHub Pages Configuration
GitHub Pages with Next.js requires:
1. Static HTML export ✅
2. A .nojekyll file to prevent Jekyll processing ✅
3. Proper asset path configuration ✅

## Rollback Plan
In case of critical issues:
1. Revert to the previous commit in the GitHub Pages repo
2. Re-deploy the previous version
3. Address issues in the cyberpunk-blog project before attempting migration again

## Conclusion
The migration from Hugo to Next.js was successfully completed. The new site maintains compatibility with the Obsidian workflow while providing a modern cyberpunk aesthetic. All existing content has been preserved, and the site is now deployed to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions for automated deployment.
