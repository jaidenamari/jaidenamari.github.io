Spent the evening in the mountain valley. The stream ran by swift and succulent as always in the spring. We have been building a lot in a short time there. I'm ready to live on the property full time, but there always seems to be ebbs in flows in how much time and money allows. 

Regardless, it was a delight to get to watch the full moon rise over the mountain. The anticipation of it cresting over the trees is always palatable. 

There was good company and good food. It really was a nice cleanse from all the digital noise. Mixtures of the world feeling too chaotic, and the stillness inside of me has been unsettling. I don't want to necessarily go hide under a rock, but the sentiment is not too far off. 

## in the works

The creative juices have started flowing. I have many projects in the works, and I would like to have the satisfaction of completing one. This is coming up. The Community Supported Agriculture app is nearly done. It is not going to be as easy as I was hoping to white label since I didn't really understand the limits and powers of Remix. It wold be nice to build out a proper landing page and multi-tenant infrastructure to support the app. 

I think I will likely try and work on some lower lift stuff, and keep working on my smaller projects to build up to that. 

Overall in the past two years, there has been a lot of plates spinning, but the knowledge that has been harvested along the way is invaluable. There is less feelings of imposter syndrome. I do not necessarily do as much cybersecurity specific stuff during my job, but this doesn't hold me back from sating my curiosity in my own time. 

Even though this blog is somewhat of a cheeky shot at making some CyberPunk thing. It's mostly going to be a place to keep notes, and track some of my progress in my endeavors. A public journal feels like a good way to hold me accountable.
