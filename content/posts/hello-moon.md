Trying something new. Documenting what I do. 

A blog to document my adventures in the technical, the liminal, the ephemeral, the phantasmagoric, and what have you.

I'm a professional, but also a human. I have the need to create emote and play. Not everything we do that is technical and professional needs to be serious. Technical writing is the bran flakes of experiences it's plain, its dry, it does good work. But in a world quickly adapting AI to every possible situation there needs to be some succulent flavors and dynamics in writing that offset the 1..2..3 mentality.
