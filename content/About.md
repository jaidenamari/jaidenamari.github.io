I'm Spriggan, a security engineer and web application developer.

I enjoy coding, and exploring both digital and natural environments. I live a balanced life close to the natural rhythms, gardening, basking in the sun like a lizard, and wuffling around for foragables.

My expertise spans across vulnerability assessment, secure coding practices, and building full-stack web applications. When I'm not spelunking the digital world I'm usually getting into faerie mischief, planting gardens, and composting. 


#### What are my actual expertise?

Building full stack applications using angular, tsed, react, typescript/javascript, Remix, node.js, aws, cloudflare, github. -- Would like to build a webapp with flask or some other python framwork, just for intrigue. 

Security Policy, Reverse Engineering APIs, webapp vulnerability scanning.

Hopefully this blog will give me an excuse to build little security utilities, and get back into my hacking roots. Would be interesting to get into some AI security related topics. 

Staging a few projects that are small would be good for growing the blog. Can write a post about the process of updating the blog to the new digital layout. Can talk about why I may have wanted to do that. 

Ideas:
- Obsidian Theme
- SaaS template for quickly standing up new apps
- Add digital snakes (the snaking hour)
- Update blog theme to be more cutesy cyberpunk garden.
- Update blog to have a better "Logo", favicon. Add a bit more of the organic elements, and not just random triangles and shapes in the background.
- Come up with 3 Basic cybersecurity tools, can be remixes of current tools, but we can custom build them in Languages we are curious about, or that have specialized use cases.
- Some kind of "vibe code" security tool, or ruleset to help vibe coders to ensure their code is more secure.
- Some Coding best practices documents for writing secure code
- Protocol analysis and wiki about general knowledge and stuff discovered while working. Like finding out about Angular state management problems, or little gotchyas with writing testing frameworks.
- Jest Security Testing.
- CI/CD security tools for github deployments to catch patterns that may be problematic during deployment.
- An IRC chat app that works e2e.
- IoT Security Writup / Testing tool.
